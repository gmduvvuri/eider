Empirically Informed Differential emission measure models for EUV Reconstruction: uses the methods described in 2021ApJ...913...40D to fit DEM (= differential emission measure) models to observational constraints and reconstruct unobserved Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV, 100 - 912 Angstroms) spectra from collisionally dominated plasma.
