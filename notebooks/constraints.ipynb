Depending on the wavelength resolution of the observation, it may not be possible to measure their fluxes separately, but still be possible to measure the total integrated flux of both lines. By entering the flux of the \"S IV]\" line as $0 \\pm 0$ and the flux of the \"O IV]\" line as $1.1 \\pm 0.1 \\times 10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (the latter is the total flux measurement), we can query CHIANTI for the contribution functions associated with both these lines and associate their sum with the observed flux.

    "This plot color-codes the pixels by the intensity of the contribution function, with the $x$-axis representing temperature on the same scale as the 1D plot above, and the $y$-axis representing wavelength. The contribution functions associated with emission lines are restricted to narrow rows and don't extend very far in temperature because they are narrowly peaked functions of temperature (as in the 1D plot), unlike the broader \"spec\" associated contribution functions. In general, X-ray wavelengths are associated with hotter ($> 10^6$ K) coronal material and FUV wavelengths are associated with cooler ($10^5$ K) transition region and chromospheric material."
